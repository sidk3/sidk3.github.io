Hi! I'm Siddhartha Koushik, a full-stack developer and an AR/VR intern with experience in:

- Building real-time systems for smart factories
- Working with Unity for immersive VR development
- Applying machine learning in federated systems
- Exploring backend tech like Node.js, Express, MongoDB

When I'm not coding, I'm probably writing technical notes or solving algorithmic puzzles!
